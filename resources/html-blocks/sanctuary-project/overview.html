  We did it! We raised funds to purchase permanent land for the dogs of FAAN who
  were facing eviction. We are now entering building construction so that our
  dogs will have a safe and modern sanctuary that, hand in hand with education,
  prevention, and adoption, will make a real difference in Cuenca's care and
  kindness for abandoned, rescued, and vulnerable dogs.

  We are thrilled to share with you the first look at FAAN's SuperDogs Sanctuary
  where UnderDogs become SuperDogs!
